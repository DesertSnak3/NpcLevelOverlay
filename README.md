# NPC Level Overlay Plugin for RuneLite

A RuneLite plugin that displays NPC combat information above their heads, including combat levels, max hits, and weakness indicators.

## Background

After creating an ironman account, I found myself struggling to identify which NPCs posed the greatest threat during combat. While the vanilla game shows combat levels through right-click menus, there was no easy way to quickly assess:
- Which NPCs could hit hard enough to be dangerous
- What combat style or spell would be most effective against them
- Which monsters I should avoid based on my current combat level

This plugin was created to solve these problems by providing at-a-glance information about NPCs directly in the game world.

## Features

### üéØ Combat Level Display
- Shows NPC combat levels above their heads
- Color-coded based on level difference:
  - **Green**: Lower level than you (safe to fight)
  - **Yellow**: Same level as you
  - **Orange**: 1-3 levels higher (use caution)
  - **Red**: 4+ levels higher (dangerous!)

### üí• Max Hit Display
- Shows the maximum damage an NPC can deal in brackets (e.g., `[23]`)
- Simplified display shows only the max hit value
- Helps ironmen and hardcore players avoid potentially deadly encounters
- Data sourced from comprehensive monster database

### ‚öîÔ∏è Weakness Icons
- Displays icons indicating what the NPC is weak to:
  - **Elemental Magic**: Fire üî•, Water üíß, Earth üåç, Air üí® (shown when weak to specific elements)
  - **General Magic**: Magic Icon ‚ú® (shown when weak to magic but no specific element)
  - **Melee Styles**: Stab üó°Ô∏è, Slash ‚öîÔ∏è, Crush üî®
  - **Ranged Weapons**: Arrow üèπ, Bolt üéØ, Dart üìç, General Ranged üèπ
- Smart weakness detection:
  - Analyzes NPC defense stats to determine primary weakness
  - Magic-using NPCs show elemental weaknesses
  - Defaults to slash icon when no specific weakness is known
- Icons are scaled to be visible but not intrusive

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Smart Aggression Indicators
- Shows an icon for NPCs that will actually attack you based on combat levels
- Uses OSRS aggression formula: NPCs stop attacking when your level > (2 √ó NPC level + 1)
- Example: Level 28 hobgoblins won't show aggression icon for level 57+ players
- Helps identify which monsters will actually engage you
- Particularly useful for planning training spots and safe areas

### üìã NPC Name Display
- Optionally show NPC names alongside their level
- Format: `NPC Name (Level)`

## Configuration

Access the plugin settings through the RuneLite configuration panel:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Show level** | Display the NPC's combat level | On |
| **Show NPC name** | Display the NPC's name next to its level | Off |
| **Show Max Hit** | Display the NPC's maximum possible hit | On |
| **Show Weakness Icon** | Display an icon indicating what the NPC is weak to | On |
| **Show Aggression Icon** | Display an icon for NPCs that will attack you | On |

| **Minimum Level** | Only show overlays for NPCs at or above this level | 0 |
| **Only show in combat** | Only display overlays for NPCs you're fighting | Off |

### Advanced Features

#### Filtering Options
- **Minimum Level Filter**: Set a minimum NPC level to reduce clutter (e.g., set to 7 to hide rats, chickens)
- **Combat-Only Mode**: Only show overlays for NPCs you're actively fighting
- **Flexible Display**: Toggle level, name, and max hit independently

#### Icon Customization
- **Adjustable Icon Size**: Choose from Extra Small (50%), Small (75%), Medium (100%), or Large (125%)
- **Smart Icon Display**: Icons scale properly to remain visible but not intrusive

#### Color Customization
- Custom color configuration for each level range (hidden by default in settings)
